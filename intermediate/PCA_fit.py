def compute_and_apply_pca_ne_station(df, station_name, max_day=365):
	"""
	Computes PCA on North-East displacement data for a station within a time window after the earthquake
	and applies the projection to the full data for that station.

	Includes a synthetic point (0, 0) at day 0 to anchor PCA to the known zero-displacement at the earthquake.

	Args:
		df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with 'station', 'days_since_eq', 'd_north_mm', 'd_east_mm' columns.
		station_name (str): The station to process.
		max_day (int): Maximum days after the earthquake to include in the PCA fitting window (default: 365).

	Returns:
		tuple:
			- df (pd.DataFrame): Original DataFrame with added 'pc1' and 'pc2' columns for the station.
			- eigenvectors (np.ndarray): 2Ã—2 matrix of PCA eigenvectors.
